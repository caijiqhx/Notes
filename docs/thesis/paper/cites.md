   Our techniques include a systematic introduction of aliases in combination with a “break-down” of the program control-flow; transforming high-level control transfers to indirect addressing through aliased pointers. In so doing, we transform programs to a form that yields data flow information very slowly and/or with little precision. We present a theoretical result which shows that a precise analysis of the transformed program, in the general case, is NP-hard and demonstrate the applicability of our techniques with empirical results.
